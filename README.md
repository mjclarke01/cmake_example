# cmake example

Uses google-test just as an example of including a library.
There are better ways to include google-test, see the google repo for more information.

## including libraries

* Add google-test source to the project and include as a subdirectory

* google-test is built and installed, so use cmake's find_package (Linux only)

* use a custom find_package file
